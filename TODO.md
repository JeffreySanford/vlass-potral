## Guardrails

- Go microservice is removed from MVP.
- Mode B is deferred from MVP.
- FITS proxy is deferred from MVP.

## Journal Policy

- Completed work is still being journaled.
- Primary archive location: `TODO.md` under "Archived Completed Items".
- Secondary historical context: release notes under `documentation/RELEASE-NOTES-*.md`.
- `documentation/planning/roadmap/ROADMAP.md` should stay future-facing, not become a done-work log.

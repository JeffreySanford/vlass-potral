- Responsive design optimized for mobile + desktop
- Performance target: <2.5s FCP, <100ms TBT (Lighthouse)

### Pillar 2: Sky Viewer & Datasets ✅

- Aladin.js viewer with VLASS data integration
- Shareable permalink state & snapshot export
- Multi-survey support (VLASS, public Aladin instances)

### Pillar 3: Community Notebooks ✅

- Revision history and branching
- Community moderation (hide/lock)

**MVP Explicitly NOT In Scope**:

- Mode B canvas viewer (v2)
- FITS proxy/mirroring (v2)
- Comments/threading (v1.1)

---

## Phase 2: Platform Hardening (v1.1) - Q1 2026

**Focus**: Reliability, API governance, security visibility

### Sprint 1: Type Safety & Code Quality ✅

- Test builder infrastructure (CommentBuilder, PostBuilder, etc.)
- Mock factory utilities for reusable test data
- Strict TypeScript configuration (zero `any` types)
- **Status**: 1268/1268 tests passing (100%), 82.5% coverage

### Sprint 2: Scientific Integration ✅

#### Ephemeris Backend (Weeks 3-6)

- astronomy-engine integration for position/elevation calculations
- NestJS `/api/view/ephem` endpoint
- Redis caching (24h TTL)
- JPL Horizons fallback for asteroids
- Performance: <500ms p95 latency
- **Status**: Complete with E2E validation

#### Comments & Threading ✅

- Parent-child comment relationships
- Threaded UI with recursive rendering
- Comment reporting and moderation
- Rate limiting & anti-spam
- **Status**: Backend + frontend complete

### Sprint 3: Operational Hardening ✅

- User profile pages & community linking
- Comment moderation dashboard
- Admin audit logging
- TACC integration spike (simulated)
- Login UX enhancement (improved error feedback)
- Ephemeris feature polish and frontend validation
- **Status**: All features complete (Feb 2026)

### Sprint 4: E2E Coverage & Cleanup ✅

- Production-quality e2e test infrastructure
- Code coverage reporting (Playwright + Jest)
- Documentation consolidation
- Linting & quality gate fixes
- **Status**: Complete (Feb 2026)

---

## Phase 2 Extended (v1.2): Remote Compute Gateway - Q2 2026

**Focus**: TACC integration, job orchestration, autonomous agents

### Sprint 1: Integration Foundation ✅

- TACC simulated service scaffold
- Job submission & status monitoring
- Job audit trail (lifecycle tracking)
- Error handling & retry strategies
- **Status**: 159 new tests, 100% passing

### Sprint 2: Real Gateway Connectivity (Q2 2026)

- [ ] TACC Slurm/Tapis API integration
- [ ] Credential management & security hardening
- [ ] Persistent job audit trail in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Performance monitoring & metrics

### Sprint 3: Explainable Results (Q2 2026)

- [ ] Link AI outputs to Aladin snapshots
- [ ] Agent performance dashboards
- [ ] Result provenance tracking

**Strategic Value**: Enables autonomous AI agents (AlphaCal, ImageReconstruction, AnomalyDetection) at ngVLA scale (7.5-8 GB/s data rate)

---

## Phase 3: Event Infrastructure & Scalability - Q2-Q3 2026

**Focus**: Real-time updates, multi-user coordination, scale infrastructure

### Priority 5: Event Streaming Infrastructure

- [ ] RabbitMQ cluster setup (3-node)
- [ ] Kafka integration with Schema Registry
- [ ] NestJS event handlers
- [ ] Dead Letter Queue patterns
- Target: 1000+ events/second, sub-100ms latency

### Priority 6: Real-Time Dashboards

- [ ] WebSocket server for live collaboration
- [ ] Notification service for events
- [ ] Client-side state synchronization
- [ ] Multi-user conflict resolution

### Priority 7: Scale Hardening

- [ ] Database replication & failover
- [ ] Redis cluster for cache
- [ ] API rate limiting & quotas
- [ ] Load testing at scale

---

## Phase 4: v2.0 - NRAO Ecosystem Integration - Q3-Q4 2026

**Focus**: Integration with official NRAO/VLA infrastructure

### Data Sources

- [ ] Direct NRAO data portal integration
- [ ] Proposal/observation metadata linking
- [ ] Data quality flags and curation

### Infrastructure

- [ ] FITS proxy/caching tier (Rust optional)
- [ ] Mode B canvas viewer (GPU-accelerated)
- [ ] Advanced rendering engine

### Compliance

- [ ] NRAO audit trail requirements
- [ ] Publication workflow integration
- [ ] Data retention policies

---

## Explicitly Deferred (v2+)

**Will NOT Be Implemented in Phase 2**:

- Mode B canvas viewer (requires FITS proxy infrastructure)
- Broad FITS mirroring (storage infrastructure)
- Stack replacement away from Angular + NestJS
- Kubernetes orchestration (scale to this later)
- GraphQL API (REST API sufficient for MVP)
- Microservices decomposition (monolith serving well)

**Deferred Pending Assessment**:

- Direct ML/AI pipeline execution (depends on CosmicAI maturity)
- Proprietary compute providers (TACC first, then expand)
- Official NRAO branding/integration (after Symposium 2026)

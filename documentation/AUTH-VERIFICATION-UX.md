# Auth Verification UX (MVP)

Status date: 2026-02-07

Goal: Registration/login with clear failure states and immediate access to the MVP shell.

## Anonymous
- Can browse public pages
- Redirected to login for authenticated-only routes

## Authenticated
- Can access protected app routes
- Uses JWT token from `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/register`
- Login/register failures display API-derived error text when available

## Deferred Unlocks
- Email verification UX
- Comments/replies (v1.1)
- FITS proxy privileges (v2 policy-gated)

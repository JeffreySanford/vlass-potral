Status date: 2026-02-07

## Goal
Deliver fast first paint and stable SEO-rendered pages.

## MVP SSR Targets
- Auth (`/auth/login`) and landing (`/landing`) SSR render with stable first paint
- Client hydration without blocking interaction
- Dynamic telemetry overlay rendered client-side (time/region/lat-lon)
- FCP/LCP targets per product charter

## Official Metric Source

SSR KPI reporting is tracked using product KPIs and operational monitoring for
FCP/LCP and first-render reliability.

## Deferred
- Feed/post detail SSR expansion
- Mode B fallback logic in SSR paths
- Rendering flows that depend on Go/FITS proxy

## Source of Truth
- `documentation/product/PRODUCT-CHARTER.md`
- `SCOPE-LOCK.md`

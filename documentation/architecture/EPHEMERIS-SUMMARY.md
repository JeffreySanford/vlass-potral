# Planet Search Feature - Summary & Recommendations

**Status Date**: 2026-02-10  
**Feature**: Mars/Venus/Jupiter search not resolving  
**Scope Decision**: MVP (hardcoded) vs. v1.1 (scientific)

---

## What We've Done

### ✅ Implementation Complete

1. **Multi-layered resolver** in `viewer.component.ts`:

   - Layer 1: Aladin gotoObject (Sesame - for catalog objects)
   - Layer 2: SkyBot ephemeris API (for planets, if available)
   - Layer 3: VizieR service (backup catalog resolution)
   - Layer 4: Hardcoded planet coordinates (fallback, ±5-10° accuracy)

2. **Graceful degradation**: If APIs fail, viewers still get approximate coordinates

3. **Comprehensive documentation**:

   - Technical architecture: `documentation/architecture/TARGET-RESOLUTION-EPHEMERIS.md`
   - Scope analysis: `documentation/architecture/EPHEMERIS-SCOPE-DECISION.md`
   - Debugging guide: `documentation/architecture/MARS-RESOLUTION-DEBUGGING.md`

### ⚠️ Known Issue: "Nothing shows up for mars"

User reports Mars search not working. **Possible causes**:

1. **Code working correctly but user expectation mismatch**
   - Mars centers at ±5-10° offset (not precise)
   - User expects precise centering
   - Workaround: Manual RA/Dec entry works perfectly

2. **Resolver chain not executing**
   - Check browser console for warnings
   - Verify network requests in Network tab
   - See [MARS-RESOLUTION-DEBUGGING.md](documentation/architecture/MARS-RESOLUTION-DEBUGGING.md)

3. **Aladin viewer initialization issue**
   - `gotoRaDec()` not working
   - Separate issue from resolver logic
   - Test with manual RA/Dec input first

## Decision Required: Which Path?

### Path A: Keep MVP (Hardcoded Fallback) ✅

**If**: MVP is for exploration/public education only

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented

**Cost**: $0

**User Experience**: "Mars shows vaguely in the right area; I can adjust manually"

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Use debugging guide to verify current implementation works
- [ ] Document limitation on UI/help pages
- [ ] Add status message hint: "Mars (approximate position ±10°)"
- [ ] Plan Phase 2 ephemeris backend

### Path B: Implement Scientific Ephemeris ⭐ (RECOMMENDED for Phase 2)

**If**: Phase 2 includes AI-driven science features

**Status**: ⭐ Recommended, architecture sketched, ~1-2 week effort

**Cost**: $10K-20K engineering time

**User Experience**: "Mars centers with scientific precision (±1 arcsec)"

**Technical Approach**:

```typescript
// Backend endpoint (NestJS + Astropy)
GET /api/ephem/mars?epoch=2026-02-10T14:30:00Z
→ { ra: 142.8473, dec: -15.2341, accuracy_arcsec: 1.2 }

// Frontend integration
searchTarget('mars')
  ↓ (all current resolvers fail as expected)
  ↓ (calls new /api/ephem backend)
  → Viewer centers on accurate coordinates
```

**Implementation**:

- Add Astropy to NestJS backend (Python subprocess or sidecar)
- Pre-compute daily planet positions, cache in Redis
- Extend to asteroids, comets, custom objects
- Zero external API dependencies

**When to do it**:

- Phase 2 planning (when AI calibration is greenlit)
- Spike: 1 day to evaluate Astropy + NestJS integration
- Implementation: 2 weeks (1 week development, 1 week testing/hardening)

## What's Blocking Mars Search?

### Investigation Checklist

1. **Verify implementation is active**

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   console.log(
     document.querySelector('[formGroup]')
       ?.querySelector('input[formControlName="ra"]')?.value
   );
   // Should show: 142.8 (Mars RA) after searching
   ```

2. **Check logs for resolver execution**

   ```javascript
   // Filter console for:
   // 1. "target_search_requested"
   // 2. "planet_resolution_fallback"
   // 3. Any errors
   ```

3. **Test manual coordinates**

   Manual test: Enter RA 142.8, Dec -15.2 and observe if viewer centers

If manual coordinates work but Mars search doesn't:

- Resolver chain has a bug
- Use [MARS-RESOLUTION-DEBUGGING.md](documentation/architecture/MARS-RESOLUTION-DEBUGGING.md) to diagnose

If manual coordinates don't work:

- Aladin viewer initialization is broken
- Issue is separate from resolver logic

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

#### Option 1: Verify MVP Implementation

1. Use debugging guide to confirm resolver is working
2. If working: Feature is complete for MVP
3. If not working: Debug and fix using guide

#### Option 2: Get Stakeholder Decision

1. Ask: Is MVP for exploration-only or science-ready?
2. If exploration-only: Keep hardcoded suffix implementation
3. If science-ready: Escalate to Phase 2 planning

### Short-term (2-4 weeks)

**If MVP is sufficient**:

- Document the limitation on canvas/help page
- Add UI hint for approximate coordinates
- Close issue as "working as designed"

**If scientific accuracy needed for Phase 2**:

- Create GitHub issue: "Ephemeris backend (Phase 2)"
- Add to roadmap: `documentation/planning/roadmap/ROADMAP.md`
- Spike Astropy integration (1 day)

### Medium-term (Phase 2, 3-6 months)

**When AI/science features are greenlit**:

- Implement Astropy-based ephemeris service
- Extend to support all solar system objects
- Cache daily positions in Redis
- Integrate with AI calibration features

- Documented limitation is acceptable
- Scope-appropriate for exploration

**Next step**: Debug why Mars isn't showing (see troubleshooting guide)

### For Phase 2 (3-6 months)

⭐ **Implement Astropy backend**

- Enables AI-driven scientific features
- Professional-grade coordinate accuracy
- Extensible to all solar system objects
- Proven approach in astronomy community

**Timing**: When Phase 2 science/AI roadmap is greenlit

## Questions Answered

**Q: Would scientific ephemeris fix the Mars issue?**  
✅ **YES** - Provides accurate coordinates, eliminates API dependency

**Q: Does it exceed MVP scope?**  
⚠️ **DEPENDS** - MVP prioritizes exploration (hardcoded is OK), Phase 2 prioritizes science (ephemeris needed)

**Q: What's blocking Mars now?**  
❓ **Unknown** - Either working but inaccurate, or resolver chain bug. Use debugging guide.

**Q: Which should we do?**  
🟢 **MVP**: Keep current implementation, debug if not working  
🟡 **Phase 2**: Plan Astropy backend when AI features greenlit  
🔴 **JPL API**: Don't recommend (introduces external dependency risk)

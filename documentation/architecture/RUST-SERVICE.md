# Rust Service (Deferred)

Status date: 2026-02-07

Rust is optional and not required for MVP.

## Introduce Rust only if
1. Snapshot generation cannot meet quality/performance targets without it.
2. SSR preview generation becomes CPU-bound in production.
3. v2 Mode B scope is approved.

Until then, keep active architecture at Angular + NestJS.

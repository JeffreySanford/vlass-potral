# Sprint 5.3 Week 3 - Implementation Guide

## Final Phase: E2E Integration & Validation

**Target Completion**: February 27, 2026  
**Status**: Ready to execute  
**Total Tests Target**: 15+ integration tests

---

## Week 3 Overview

Week 3 focuses on end-to-end validation of the entire Kafka event infrastructure. This includes verifying that events published by JobOrchestratorService flow through all 4 consumer services correctly, error scenarios are handled, and system performance meets requirements.

### Architecture

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1 (Monday, Feb 24): E2E Workflow Tests

**Goal**: Verify complete event flow from job submission to all consumers processing

#### Test 1: Complete Job Lifecycle Flow

- Submit job via JobOrchestratorService.submitJob()
- Verify job.submitted published to Kafka
- Verify JobEventsConsumer receives and sends notification
- Verify AuditTrailConsumer stores immutable event
- **Assert**: All 3 consumers processed event within 5 seconds

#### Test 2: Job Completion with Multiple Consumer Processing

- Complete job via JobOrchestratorService.completeJob()
- Verify job.completed event published and partitioned by job_id
- Verify MetricsConsumer processes metrics
- Verify NotificationService sends email notification
- Verify ComplianceAuditor logs completion
- **Assert**: All 4 event handlers executed successfully

#### Test 3: Job Failure Scenario

- Trigger job failure via JobOrchestratorService.failJob()
- Verify all 3 consumers handle job.failed event
- Verify failure alert triggered by SystemHealthMonitor
- **Assert**: Error handling is non-blocking (consumers don't crash)

#### Test 4: Cancellation Flow

- Cancel active job
- Verify JobEventsConsumer notifies user of cancellation
- Verify AuditTrailConsumer records cancellation
- **Assert**: Cancellation event reaches all subscribers

#### Test 5: Partition Key Ordering

- Submit 3 jobs with same job_id pattern
- Verify all events for same job reach same partition
- Verify MetricsConsumer processes in order
- **Assert**: Per-job event ordering maintained

**Commands**:

```bash
# Run E2E tests
pnpm nx test cosmic-horizons-api --testFile="**/e2e-workflow.spec.ts"

# Expected: 5/5 tests passing ✅
```

- Verify consumer continues consuming next message
- **Assert**: Non-blocking error handling works

#### Test 7: Kafka Connection Failure

- Simulate Kafka broker failure

#### Test 9: Missing Required Fields

- Publish event missing required fields (e.g., job_id)
- Verify all consumers validate schema
- Verify ComplianceAuditor still stores event (for audit)
- **Assert**: Schema validation is consistent

#### Test 10: Consumer Lag Under Load

- Publish 100 events rapidly to job-metrics topic
- Measure consumer lag

### Day 4 (Thursday, Feb 27): Integration & Compliance

**Goal**: Verify enterprise requirements met

#### Test 16: Audit Trail Immutability

- Verify ComplianceAuditorService generates immutable hash

**Commands**:

```bash
# Run integration tests
pnpm nx test cosmic-horizons-api --testFile="**/integration.spec.ts"

# Expected: 3/3 tests passing ✅
```

**Next Steps**:

1. Create detailed test implementation files (e2e-workflow.spec.ts, error-scenarios.spec.ts, performance.spec.ts, integration.spec.ts)
2. Execute daily on schedule
3. Update SPRINT-5-3-PROGRESS.md daily
4. Document any blockers immediately

**Ready to go week 3! 🚀**

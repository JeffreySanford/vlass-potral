# Docker Bootstrap (MVP)

Status date: 2026-02-07

## MVP Services

- postgres
- redis

Application services (`vlass-web`, `vlass-api`) are started via Nx after infra
is healthy:

```bash
pnpm start:all
```

Or manually:

```bash
pnpm start:infra
pnpm start:web
pnpm start:api
```

## Deferred Services

- Go microservice containers
- Mode B-specific workers

## Notes

If a future v1.1 or v2 feature introduces new services, update
`PRODUCT-CHARTER.md` and `SCOPE-LOCK.md` first.

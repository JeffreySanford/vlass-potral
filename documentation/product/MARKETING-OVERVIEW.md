## Executive Summary

**VLASS Portal** is an open-source, web-native scientific operations platform for radio astronomy. It provides researchers with fast, intuitive access to massive astronomical datasets (VLASS), powerful tools for AI-assisted analysis, and infrastructure for publishing reproducible scientific findings.

### What It Does (In One Sentence)

> VLASS Portal transforms how radio astronomers explore, analyze, and share discoveries from the Very Large Array Sky Survey—combining instant visualization, AI-driven insights, collaborative notebooks, and reproducible research workflows in a single web application.

### The Vision

**Build the missing layer between cutting-edge ML research and operational scientific discovery:**

- **Today's problem:** Radio astronomy researchers have state-of-the-art AI models and petaflops of compute, but interact through Jupyter notebooks (2012-era UX). There's no unified platform for orchestrating, auditing, and publishing AI-assisted analysis.

- **VLASS Portal's solution:** A modern web platform that brings world-class data exploration, AI orchestration, reproducibility, and scientific publishing into a single, intuitive interface.

- **Strategic opportunity:** Position VLASS Portal as the control plane for the NSF-Simons CosmicAI Initiative and the operational backbone for the upcoming ngVLA (Next Generation Very Large Array) facility.

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value | Significance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MVP Completion** | 3 major pillars | Ready for operations and community launch |
| **Phase 2 Timeline** | 12–16 weeks | AI inference + reproducibility foundation |
| **Phase 3 Timeline** | 16–20 weeks | Multi-site federation + TACC integration |
| **Total Investment** | $300K–$600K | 2–3 year path to national infrastructure |
| **Target Users** | 15+ institutions | NSF-affiliated research centers |
| **Strategic Partners** | CosmicAI, NRAO, TACC | Decades-long facilities and initiatives |

## The Problem

### Radio Astronomy Data Explosion

The Very Large Array (VLA) and next-generation facilities produce **petabytes of data annually**, but the astronomer's experience of accessing and analyzing that data remains fragmented:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Petabytes of<br/>VLASS Data"] -->|"HiPS tiles,<br/>FITS files"| B["Separate<br/>Tools"]

- **Center:** Fragmented tool ecosystem (Aladin, IPython, Bash, Email)
- **Right side:** Researcher pain points (context switching, no reproducibility, slow collaboration)
- **Color-code:** Red for problems, green for desired state

### The CosmicAI Gap

The NSF-Simons CosmicAI Initiative is producing breakthrough algorithms:

- **Calibration anomaly detection** (Eric Murphy, NSF NRAO)
- **AlphaCal autonomous interferometric processing** (production-ready)
- **Hyperspectral event detection** via transfer learning (Ce-Ci Xue)
- **Radio image reconstruction** neural networks (Omkar Bait)

**But:** These models live in GitHub repositories and JupyterHub notebooks. They lack:
- Enterprise-grade operational UI
- Reproducibility frameworks
- Governance and audit trails
- Published workflows

### The ngVLA Challenge (2030s)

The Next Generation Very Large Array will deliver:

- **244 antennas**, each 18 meters in diameter
- **Frequencies:** 1.2 GHz to 116 GHz
- **Sensitivity:** 10× greater than current VLA
- **Data rate:** ~50 petabytes *per year*
- **Compute requirement:** **50 petaFLOPS** (100× current!)

**The reality:** Astronomers will need real-time operational dashboards, not notebooks. A platform that doesn't exist today.

## Phase 2: AI Integration Foundation

### Vision

Transform VLASS Portal from a **data browser** into an **AI-driven scientific operations platform**.

**The leap:** From "explore data and write about it" → "analyze data with AI models, get interpretable results, publish reproducible findings."

### Four Core Pillars

#### **Pillar 1: Inference Service Layer**

Integrate CosmicAI production algorithms as first-class services.

**What you build:**
- NestJS inference orchestration service
- Model registry (versioning, compute requirements, deployment manifesto)
- Job submission API (request queuing, lifecycle tracking)
- Result storage (JSON artifacts + HiPS overlays)
- WebSocket status streaming (real-time updates)

**Models you integrate (prioritized):**

1. **Calibration Anomaly Detection** (Eric Murphy, NSF NRAO)
   - Detects problematic data in interferometric calibration
   - Latency: <10s for typical VLASS cutout
   - Status: Production-ready for Phase 2

2. **AlphaCal** (Autonomous Interferometric Calibration)
   - Replaces manual calibration workflows
   - Status: Productionizable (containerized)

3. **Hyperspectral Event Detection** (Transfer Learning, Ce-Ci Xue)
   - Identifies spectral transitions + anomalies
   - Status: Mid-stability (Phase 2.1)

4. **Radio Image Reconstruction** (Omkar Bait)
   - Neural-network-based image synthesis
   - Status: Research-adjacent (Phase 2+ optional)

**User experience:**

```

  ↓
[Choose "Analyze" button]
  ↓
[Select model: "Calibration Anomaly Detection"]
  ↓
[Tune parameters (confidence threshold, region size)]
  ↓
[Click "Run Analysis"]
  ↓
[Inference runs (1–10s) on GPU]
  ↓
[Results render as red/yellow overlay on viewer]
  ↓
["Save to post" → embeds model output + reproducibility recipe]
```

---

#### **Pillar 2: GPU Job Orchestration**

Transform VLASS Portal into a **reliable, auditable job submission interface**.

**What you build:**
- Local job queue manager (Kubernetes-ready architecture)
- Priority tiers (interactive <1min, batch <10min, long-running >10min)
- Retry logic (exponential backoff for transient GPU failures)
- Result caching (by dataset + model + parameters hash)
- Job monitoring UI (status, progress, resource usage, error logs)
- WebSocket live updates (no polling)

**Key feature: Caching**

```mermaid
graph LR
    U["User requests<br/>analysis"] --> Q["Job queue checks:<br/>cache hit?"]
    Q -->|"Yes (50%+ of time)"| C["Return cached<br/>result (instant)"]
    Q -->|"No"| I["Allocate GPU"]
    I --> R["Run inference"]
    R --> S["Store result<br/>+ cache entry"]
    S --> C
    C --> D["Display overlay<br/>in viewer"]
```

**Impact:**
- 50%+ cache hit rate (users often re-analyze)
- Queue depth <5 seconds typical
- 99.5% job completion rate (retryable failures)

---

#### **Pillar 3: Reproducibility Framework**

Make **every analysis reproducible**: track dataset → model → parameters → output as a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

**What you build:**
- Analysis graph (immutable lineage linking inputs to outputs)
- Experiment versioning + tagging
- Reproducibility API (`GET /experiment/{id}/graph`, `POST /experiment/{id}/fork?dataset=xyz`)
- Full-stack versioning (dataset versions, model versions, code versions)

**Use case:**

> Research published: "We detected 47 calibration anomalies in VLASS region RA=100, Dec=+30"
> 
> Three months later, new VLASS data released.
> 
> Colleague says: "Let's replay this analysis on new data"
> 
> VLASS Portal:
> - Checks: original analysis pinned to CosmicAI model v2.3 ✓
> - Verifies: model still available, no breaking changes ✓
> - Replays: same workflow, new dataset
> - Compares: "Original: 47 anomalies. New dataset: 52 anomalies. What changed?"

**Success metrics:**
- 100% of inferences reproducible (linkage complete)
- ≥30% of published posts include reproducibility recipe
- 0% "model not found" errors (versioning automated)

---

#### **Pillar 4: Explainability UI**

Surface **why models made decisions**.

**What you build:**
- Model output interpretation layer (saliency heat maps, attribution)
- "Why was this region flagged?" explanations (top 3 influencing features)
- Confidence scores + uncertainty bounds
- Expert validation (community tags, consensus scoring)
- False positive tracking + feedback loops

**Example:**

User sees red anomaly region in viewer. Hovers over it. Panel appears:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 Calibration Anomaly Detection
 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 
 Confidence: 91%
 
 Top influencing factors:
 1. Baseline EW-05 signal spike    (score: 0.78)
 2. Anomalous phase in 10-20 GHz   (score: 0.64)
 3. RFI detected in band 3         (score: 0.52)
 
 Expert consensus: 8/9 radio 
 astronomers agree (real anomaly)
 
 [Save to post]  [Report as FP]
```

**User confidence:** 80%+ rate explainability as "helpful or better"

---

| **Total** | **$107K–$153K** | Self-fundable or grant-supported |

**Timeline:** Feb–Aug 2026 (parallel with grant writing)

---

## Phase 3: CosmicAI Federation & ngVLA Preparation

### Vision

Establish VLASS Portal as the **control plane** for the NSF-Simons CosmicAI ecosystem, and prepare for the Next Generation VLA's petaflop-scale challenge.

**The leap:** From local inference → federated multi-site orchestration.

### Four Core Pillars

#### **Pillar 1: Dataset Federation**

Unified discovery across **NRAO + CosmicAI curations + TACC + ngVLA** data sources.

**What you build:**
- Federated dataset registry (multi-source authentication, metadata sync)
- Data APIs for each source:
  - **NRAO:** VLASS HiPS, FITS endpoints, API proxies
  - **TACC:** S3 bucket manifests, POSIX mounting for large files
  - **CosmicAI:** Versioned, curated dataset packages (JupyterHub-ready)
  - **ngVLA:** Placeholder for future integration
- Data lineage tracking (origin, versions, provenance)
- Query aggregation ("Show all VLASS + CosmicAI datasets in RA/Dec region")

**User experience:**

```
[Dataset dropdown]
  ↓
[Select region: RA=100–110, Dec=+20–+30]
  ↓
[Federated query (NRAO + CosmicAI + TACC)]
  ↓
[Results ranked by: access speed, completeness, freshness]
  ↓
[User picks: "VLASS QL v3.2 (NRAO)" + "CosmicAI calibrated subset"]
  ↓
[Both datasets simultaneously loaded in viewer]
```

**Success metric:** Dataset queries resolve in <2s

---

#### **Pillar 2: TACC Compute Integration**

Submit workflows to **TACC GPU clusters**; monitor, cache, audit remotely.

**What you build:**
- TACC authentication bridge (OAuth/OIDC to TACC allocation)
- Slurm job submission (via XSEDE/ACCESS API)
- Remote job monitoring (real-time status polling)
- Data staging orchestration (inputs → TACC, results ← TACC)
- Distributed caching (cache consistency across vlass-portal + TACC)
- Cost accounting (track GPU allocation consumed per job)

**System architecture:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph VP["vlass-portal<br/>(User Interface)"]
        UI["Web UI"]
        CACHE["Local Cache"]
    end
    
    subgraph AUTH["Authentication"]
        OAUTH["OAuth→TACC"]
    end
    
    subgraph TACC_["TACC Infrastructure"]
        AUTH_T["TACC Jobmon"]
        SLURM["Slurm Scheduler"]
        NODES["GPU Cluster<br/>V100, A100"]
        CACHE_T["Results Cache<br/>S3"]
    end
    
    UI -->|"User submits<br/>job request"| OAUTH
    OAUTH -->|"Authorized<br/>to TACC"| SLURM
    SLURM -->|"Allocates GPU,<br/>schedules"| NODES
    NODES -->|"Runs inference"| CACHE_T
    CACHE_T -->|"Results"| CACHE
    CACHE -->|"Notifies client<br/>WebSocket"| UI
```

**User experience:**

```
User chooses: "Run on TACC Cluster" (vs. local)
  ↓
Portal checks: TACC allocation + quota
  ↓
Portal prepares job manifest:
  - Dataset URI
  - Model + version
  - Parameters
  - Compute requirements (GPU type, memory)
  ↓
Portal checks cache: is identical result cached at TACC?
  ↓ [If cached] Return result (instant)
  ↓ [If not cached] Submit Slurm job
  ↓
Monitor job: Status → [queued] → [running] → [complete]
  ↓
Fetch results into vlass-portal cache
  ↓
Render in viewer + notify user
```

**Benefits:**
- Unlimited GPU availability (TACC allocation)
- Bursting for large analyses
- 50%+ cross-site cache hit rate
- Full audit trail (Slurm job logs)

---

#### **Pillar 3: Multi-Site Reproducibility**

Enable reproducibility across **NRAO + TACC + CosmicAI** institutional boundaries.

**What you build:**
- Extended experiment graph with multi-site sources:
  - Input: "vlass" | "cosmicai_curated" | "nrao_archive" + version
  - Processing: "vlass-portal" | "tacc" + GPU spec
  - Model: CosmicAI GitHub repo + commit SHA
  - Output: destination site + bucket + retention policy
- Reproducibility manifest (immutable JSON-LD artifact)
- Replay orchestration (fork + rerun with new dataset)
- Semantic web integration (DOI-ready metadata)

**Example lineage graph:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    D["Dataset:<br/>VLASS v3.2<br/>(NRAO)"]
    M["Model:<br/>Calibration Anomaly<br/>v2.3 (CosmicAI/GitHub)"]
    P["Processing:<br/>TACC GPU<br/>A100, 8hrs"]
    R["Result:<br/>Anomaly regions<br/>(TACC S3)"]
    PUB["Published:<br/>Zenodo<br/>DOI"]
    
    D --> P
    M --> P
    P --> R
    R --> PUB
```

**Scientific impact:** Enables funding agencies (NSF, DOE) to automatically verify reproducibility before awarding grants.

---

#### **Pillar 4: Explainability Aggregation**

Combine explanations from **multiple models** at multiple sites.

**What you build:**
- Multi-model explanation aggregation (same data, multiple algorithms)
- Uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals across sites)
- Expert validation pipeline (community consensus scoring)
- Post-publication auditing (retraction banners, updates)

**Example:**

Same VLASS region analyzed by:
- CosmicAI calibration detection (TACC): 91% confidence anomaly
- Local AlphaCal (vlass-portal): 87% confidence anomaly
- Manual astronomer review (expert): "Confirmed real anomaly"

Viewer shows:
```
Both models agree: ✓ (green)
Confidence: 89% average
Expert consensus: 9/9 radio astronomers agree

[HIGH CONFIDENCE — Suitable for publication]
```

## Strategic Alignment & Impact

### CosmicAI Integration

The NSF-Simons CosmicAI Initiative produced breakthrough results at the 247th American Astronomical Society Meeting (Feb 2026):

**CosmicAI's strength:** World-class ML models
- Calibration anomaly detection (production-ready)
- AlphaCal (autonomous interferometric calibration)
- Hyperspectral event detection (transfer learning)
- Radio image reconstruction (neural networks)

**CosmicAI's weakness:** No operational interface
- Models live in GitHub repositories
- Researchers interact via Jupyter notebooks
- No governance, reproducibility, or audit trails
- Not scalable to petaflop data volumes

**VLASS Portal's role:** Become the **missing operations layer**

### Budget Overview

**Total investment to reach national infrastructure (Phases 1–4):**

```
Investment trajectory:
  MVP        Phase 2      Phase 3          Phase 4
  $0         $100–200K    $200–400K        $500K–1M
  (done)     (2026)       (2026–27)        (2027+)
  
  Cumulative: $800K–1.6M over 3 years
```

### Phase 2: Self-Fundable ($100K–$200K)

**Realistic scenario:**
- Engineering labor: $100K–$150K (1.5–2 FTE, 12–16 weeks)
- Development compute: $5K (cloud GPU instances)
- Tools/software: $2K–$3K (optional)
- **Total: $107K–$153K**

**Funding sources:**
- Internal R&D budget (departmental)
- University seed funding
- NSF/DOE preliminary grant (often $50K exploratory)

**Risk:** Low. System is optional; can pause mid-project.

### Phase 3: Grant-Accelerated ($200K–$400K)

**Requires external funding for scale.**

**Grant targets:**

1. **NSF SI² (Research Software Engineering)**
   - Budget: $150K–$300K (24 months typical)
   - Due dates: Apr, Aug (rolling)
   - Success rate: 20–25%
   - Why you qualify: Infrastructure component of funded CosmicAI initiative

2. **DOE ASCR (Advanced Scientific Computing Research)**
   - Budget: $200K–$400K (24 months)
   - Due dates: Rolling submissions (no fixed deadline)
   - Success rate: 25–30%
   - Why you qualify: Workflow orchestration, HPC + cloud integration, ngVLA planning

3. **NVIDIA GPU Research Program**
   - Budget: $50K–$150K + GPU credits
   - Turnaround: 4–8 weeks
   - Success rate: 60–70% (industry partnerships more flexible)
   - Why you qualify: Multi-site GPU orchestration showcase

4. **NSF CIS (Post-Phase 3, 2027)**
   - Budget: $300K–$1M (3–4 years, national infrastructure)
   - Success rate: 15–20% (very competitive; community validation critical)
   - **Timing:** Pursue after Phase 3 demonstrates impact

### Funding Timeline (2026–2027)

```
Feb 2026 (now)
  ├─ Finalize Phase 2/3 planning (done)
  ├─ Contact NSF program officers (informal feedback)
  └─ Reach out to NVIDIA (60% success likely)
     ↓
Mar–Apr 2026
  ├─ Draft NSF SI² proposal (due Apr 15–May 15)
  └─ Begin Phase 2 (unfunded or internal)
     ↓
May–Jun 2026
  ├─ Submit DOE ASCR (rolling deadline)
  └─ Accelerate Phase 2 with best effort
     ↓
Jul–Aug 2026
  ├─ Wait for grant decisions
  └─ Continue Phase 2 engineering
     ↓
Sep–Oct 2026
  ├─ Grant decisions returning (4–6 month review)
  ├─ If awarded (1 in 3 chance): Hire team, accelerate Phase 3
  └─ If not awarded: Continue at 50% pace, pivot to NVIDIA + CIS 2027
     ↓
Jan–Jun 2027
  └─ Phase 3 ramping (grant + internal)
     ↓
Jun–Aug 2027
  └─ Prepare NSF CIS proposal (larger, $300K–$1M)
```

### Honest Assessment

**Realistic outcome:** You'll self-fund Phase 2 fully (MVP → AI inference works). For Phase 3 scale, one of {NSF, DOE, NVIDIA} likely succeeds. If not, you can do Phase 3 on extended timeline (24–30 weeks instead of 16–20).

**Key advantage:** Early execution (Phase 2 in 2026) makes grant proposals *much* stronger. Reviewers see working software, not promises.

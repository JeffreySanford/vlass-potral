# Affiliation and Data Usage

## Project Status

Cosmic Horizon is an independent software project created for public portfolio and community use.

It is **not**:

- an official VLA product,

- an official NRAO product,

- an official VLASS program deliverable,

- sponsored or endorsed by those organizations.

## Data Usage

- The project uses publicly available VLASS and related astronomy data/services.

- Data/source ownership remains with the original providers.

- The application adds independent UX/workflow layers (SSR, viewer state, notebook collaboration).

## Communication Rule

When describing this repo publicly, use wording like:

## "Independent portal using public VLASS data; not affiliated with VLA/NRAO."

## Outreach Rule (Important)

When contacting VLA/NRAO/CosmicAI or presenting at conferences:

- Describe Cosmic Horizon as independent and integration-ready.
- Do not imply endorsement, partnership, or official status.
- Distinguish "implemented now" from "planned integration direction."
- Include date-stamped sources for any external trend/statistic claims.

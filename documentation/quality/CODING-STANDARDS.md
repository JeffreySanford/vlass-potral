# Coding Standards (MVP)

Status date: 2026-02-07
Canonical scope: `documentation/product/PRODUCT-CHARTER.md` + `SCOPE-LOCK.md`.

## Core Rules
- Nx-first task execution
- Keep TypeScript strict and testable
- Prefer simple module boundaries
- Keep docs consistent with `libs/shared/models` contracts
- Favor RxJS observables (hot/live streams) over ad-hoc Promises for UI + service flows; keep request/stream lifecycles explicit.

## MVP Boundaries in Code
- Viewer Mode A only
- No Go service integration
- No FITS proxy code paths
- No comment system code paths

## Deferred Work Handling
If implementing v1.1/v2 work (comments, Mode B, FITS proxy), gate with explicit roadmap updates first.

# NRAO Helpdesk Policy Request Template

Subject: `Request for guidance: FITS access and derivative-use boundaries for independent public-data workflow project`

Hello NRAO Team,

I am an independent developer working on an open-source project (`vlass-portal`) focused on public VLASS-compatible workflows.

Before implementing any FITS-oriented features, I want to ensure full policy compliance. Could you please clarify:

1. What FITS access patterns are permitted for independent/public-facing tooling?
2. What derivative-use patterns are permitted (cached products, transformed outputs, redistributed artifacts)?
3. Whether written approval is required for any of these patterns.
4. The best contact for technical follow-up once policy boundaries are confirmed.

I am intentionally requesting guidance first so I can stay within NRAO/VLA rules.

Project reference: `github.com/JeffreySanford/vlass-portal`

Best regards,  
Jeffrey Sanford

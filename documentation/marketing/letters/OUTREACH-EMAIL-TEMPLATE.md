Subject: `vlass-portal: operational web interface for CosmicAI/ngVLA workflows (Cosmic Horizons 2026)`

Hello [Name],

I am the sole developer of `vlass-portal`, an independent open-source idea/prototype built around public VLASS workflows (`github.com/JeffreySanford/vlass-portal`).

I recently completed three platform pillars:

- SSR fast first paint for responsive access
- Aladin viewer integration with permalink/snapshot workflows
- Notebook-style posts with revision history for reproducible collaboration

Based on CosmicAI and Cosmic Horizons priorities, I believe this aligns as research software infrastructure: a web-native operations/control-plane layer for AI-driven radio pipelines (calibration, reconstruction, anomaly detection), complementary to backend compute ecosystems.

To make the next step meaningful, I would likely need to support FITS-oriented workflows.

Before I implement any FITS-oriented features, could you please confirm what access and derivative-use patterns are permitted, and whether written approval is required?

I am also opening this question through NRAO Helpdesk to ensure I follow the official policy path first.

If this direction is potentially useful, would you be open to connecting me with a software engineer or technical lead to discuss:

- feasibility and integration boundaries,
- policy/compliance constraints,
- whether this should be explored as a future collaboration.

I am currently not in a position to travel to Cosmic Horizons 2026, but I would still value a quick fit check on this framing.

If helpful, I can provide open-source presentation-ready materials (architecture overview, diagrams, abstract text, and documentation) that your team could use internally or in related program discussions.

I can also share a short architecture note and demo recording.

Best regards,

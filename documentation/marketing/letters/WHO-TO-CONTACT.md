# Who To Contact For Proposal Positioning

Status date: 2026-02-10

Treat this as a research software/infrastructure proposal, not a pure theory proposal.

## Who Runs CosmicAI (Current Public Info)

- CosmicAI is the **NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins**.
- It is **UT Austin-led** (not an NRAO-only project).
- NRAO is a major institutional partner in a multi-organization consortium.

Current leadership shown publicly:

- Stella Offner (UT Austin) - PI and Director
- Matt Lease (UT Austin) - Co-Director
- Pratik Mhatré (UT Austin) - Managing Director (general inquiries)
- Eric Murphy (NRAO) - Co-PI / Observable Universe Astro Lead

Implication for outreach:

- Start with institute/program leadership for fit.
- Then align with NRAO policy/data-rights contacts for permission boundaries.
- Then move to technical leads (ngVLA/RADPS/Data Processing) for implementation feasibility.

## Priority Order (Recommended)

1. Program/strategy owner (CosmicAI/NRAO program manager, WG lead)
2. Policy/data-rights owner (NRAO archive/helpdesk/policy contact)
3. Technical owner (ngVLA/RADPS/Data Processing technical lead)
4. Individual engineers (including hiring-posting contacts)
5. Conference organizer inbox (submission logistics only)

## Why This Order

- Program/WG contacts decide scope fit.
- Policy contacts define what is actually permitted (especially FITS/derivatives).
- Technical leads determine integration feasibility and interfaces.
- Individual engineers are helpful after scope/policy alignment.
- Organizers validate deadlines/format, not strategic direction.

## Important Distinction

Job postings for software engineers are relevant signals, but they are not the best first channel for permission/scope decisions.

Use job-posting contacts after:

1. fit is validated by program owners, and
2. policy boundaries are clarified.

## NRAO/VLA Contact Path (Practical)

This is the recommended channel sequence for your specific use case:

1. NRAO Science Helpdesk (policy/data-rights routing first)
2. Archive/policy clarification (proprietary + derivative-use boundaries)
3. Technical handoff to ngVLA/RADPS/Data Processing lead
4. Optional local VLA/Socorro operations contact for facility routing

VLA ground-team outreach is not silly, but it should usually come after Helpdesk policy routing for permission-sensitive FITS questions.

## Positioning Statement

`vlass-portal` is a web-native operational interface for AI-driven radio astronomy pipelines, intended to complement CosmicAI/NRAO backend compute with workflow orchestration, reproducibility, and human-facing domain UX.

## Two-Message Sequence

Message A (Program + Permission fit check):

- Ask if the direction is useful.
- Ask explicitly what FITS/derivative patterns are permitted.
- Ask whether written approval is required.
- Request referral to the correct technical lead.

Message B (Technical handoff):

- Confirm referral source.
- Request a short feasibility review (interfaces, constraints, integration boundaries).
- Offer concise architecture note and demo.

## Contact Checklist

- Include a one-sentence project definition.
- Include proof of shipped pillars (SSR, Aladin workflows, revisioned notebooks).
- Ask for fit validation and explicit permission boundaries.
- Include repo link and optional demo link.
- Avoid implying authorization from background/clearance; request formal guidance instead.

# Miro AI Prompt Pack

Use each prompt directly in Miro AI. After generation, ask Miro AI to "clean layout, align spacing, and simplify labels for executive audience."

## 1) Problem Statement Visualization

Create a left-to-right flow diagram showing radio astronomy workflow fragmentation:
Data source "Petabytes of Radio Data" fans into 4 tools: Aladin viewer, Jupyter notebooks, CLI scripts, email collaboration.
Then converge into pain points: context switching, poor reproducibility, manual sharing, no audit trail, slow discovery.
End with business impact: lower productivity, slower publication cycle, weaker grant competitiveness.
Use color progression from blue to orange to red.

## 2) Capability Pyramid

Create a 3-tier capability pyramid:
Tier 1 (MVP complete): SSR fast first paint, Aladin permalinks/snapshots, revisioned notebook posts.
Tier 2 (Phase 2): inference services, job orchestration, reproducibility framework, explainability UI.
Tier 3 (Phase 3): dataset federation, TACC integration, multi-site reproducibility, explanation aggregation.
Show dependency arrows from MVP to Phase 2 to Phase 3.

## 3) Data Volume Challenge Chart

Create a comparative chart for VLASS, ALMA, and ngVLA data scale.
Emphasize exponential increase and operational complexity gap.
Annotate: "Model progress is outpacing workflow UX and orchestration."

## 4) User Journey Storyboards

Create 3 storyboard lanes:
Lane A MVP workflow: discover sky tile -> inspect in viewer -> snapshot -> publish post.
Lane B Phase 2 workflow: select dataset -> run AI inference job -> review result -> publish reproducible notebook.
Lane C Phase 3 workflow: federated dataset query -> submit distributed GPU job -> compare multi-site outputs -> publish explainable report.
Each lane should include actor, action, and output.

## 5) Architecture Evolution

Create 3 architecture diagrams side-by-side:
MVP architecture (frontend + API + shared models).

Phase 2 architecture adding inference and job services.
Phase 3 architecture adding federation, TACC integration, and multi-site workflows.
Use consistent icon legend and increasing complexity.

## 6) Gantt Timeline

Create a timeline from Feb 2026 through Jun 2027:
MVP completion milestone in early 2026.
Phase 2 planning and implementation windows.

Conference milestone: Cosmic Horizons July 2026.
Phase 3 ramp and readiness milestones through mid-2027.

Add dependencies and critical path highlights.

## 7) Funding Landscape

Create a funding landscape visual with sources, timing windows, and rough success likelihood.
Include NSF, DOE, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure-aligned funding paths.
Show staged strategy: bridge funding -> Phase 2 execution -> larger multi-year funding.

## 8) Strategic Partnership Map

Create a hub-and-spoke ecosystem map centered on cosmic-horizons.
Primary nodes: NSF NRAO, CosmicAI, TACC, ngVLA community.
Show data, model, and operations relationships.
Label cosmic-horizons as "web-native operational interface and control plane."

## 9) Competitive Positioning Matrix

Create a 2x2 matrix comparing cosmic-horizons, Aladin, Jupyter, and Airflow.
Axes: domain-specific astronomy UX vs workflow orchestration maturity.
Position cosmic-horizons in high-high quadrant with note: "integrated domain UX + operational workflows."

## 10) Success Metrics Dashboard

Create a dashboard mock with Phase 2 and Phase 3 target metrics:
job completion rate, latency targets, reproducibility coverage, user/institution adoption, publication outputs.
## Use KPI cards + trend lines + milestone markers

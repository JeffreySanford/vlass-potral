# AI Platform Recommendation For Marketing Graphics

Status date: 2026-02-10

## Recommendation

If you want one platform only: use `Miro AI`.

Why:

- Strong at flowcharts, architecture diagrams, journey maps, timelines, and stakeholder maps.

- Good for turning text briefs into editable diagram structures quickly.

- Easy collaboration and export for deck/PDF workflows.

Best workflow for quality:

1. Generate diagram structure in Miro AI.

2. Export SVG.

3. Final polish in Figma (typography, spacing, brand consistency, print/export).

## Platform Fit For Your Visual Guide

- Problem statement visualization: Miro AI (excellent)

- Capability pyramid: Miro AI (excellent)

- Data volume challenge chart: Miro + spreadsheet chart import (good)

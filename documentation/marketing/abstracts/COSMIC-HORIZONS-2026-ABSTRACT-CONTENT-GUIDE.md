# Cosmic Horizons 2026 Abstract Content Guide

Status date: 2026-02-11
Audience: Jeffrey Sanford (independent developer)
Purpose: Convert strategy notes into a concrete, submission-ready content checklist for the April 1, 2026 abstract deadline.

## Positioning Rule

Use this positioning sentence in every abstract variant:

"Cosmic Horizon is an independent, public-data-compatible, integration-ready web platform; it is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or operated by VLA/NRAO/VLASS."

This avoids stepping on institutional ownership while keeping collaboration doors open.

## What To Include In the Abstract

1. Problem statement (human bottleneck)

- Describe the workflow break: data scale and AI pipeline complexity exceed local/manual notebook-only workflows.
- State the operational impact: researchers need fast web-native access, reproducible context sharing, and remote workflow orchestration.

2. Solution statement (front-half operations layer)

- Define Cosmic Horizon as the front-half MLOps + UX layer that complements institutional back-end compute/model systems.
- Emphasize interface value: browse, audit, share, and operationalize workflows.

3. Evidence of readiness (implemented now)

- SSR-first web delivery for fast first paint.
- Aladin-based viewer state persistence with permalink/snapshot workflows.
- Revision-controlled notebook collaboration.

4. Conference theme alignment (explicitly map)

- Explorable Universe: web-native exploration + persistent view context.
- Observable Universe: operations UI for high-volume processing workflows.
- Explainable Universe: revision history and human-in-the-loop review pathways.
- Accelerated Universe: integration-ready path for AI/GPU job orchestration.

5. Integration path (near-term and realistic)

- Note what is next: submit/status/cancel style job orchestration contracts, inference run tracking, and explainability surfaces.
- Keep these labeled as planned integration direction, not shipped capability.

## Claim Hygiene (Required)

Tag major claims internally before publishing:

- `implemented_fact`: already in code/tests/docs.
- `verified_external`: sourced with date + reference.
- `planning_hypothesis`: directional, not yet validated.

Use this shorthand in drafting notes (remove tags in final abstract text):

- `[implemented_fact] Three shipped pillars (SSR, viewer persistence, notebook revisions).`
- `[planning_hypothesis] Docking as control-plane UX for external AI compute fabrics.`
- `[verified_external] Conference date/deadline and host platform logistics.`

If a numeric ecosystem claim (for example, ngVLA data-rate figures) is not source-dated in your references table, treat it as planning context and avoid hard numeric language in final submission copy.

---

## Funding/Program Language (Safe Version)

Recommended phrasing:

- "web-native operational interface for AI-driven radio astronomy workflows"
- "MLOps + UX layer complementing institutional compute/model systems"
- "integration-ready platform for reproducible, explainable, human-in-the-loop operations"

Avoid phrasing that implies current official status:

- "NRAO platform"
- "official ngVLA interface"
- "deployed for CosmicAI"

## Abstract Skeleton (Fill-In Template)

Title:

`Cosmic Horizon: Independent Web-Native Operations Interface for AI-Driven Radio Astronomy Workflows`

Body template (~170-220 words):

1. Open with the operational problem and workflow bottleneck.
2. Introduce Cosmic Horizon as independent front-half operations UX.
3. Prove readiness with the three implemented pillars.
4. Map capabilities to Explorable/Observable/Explainable/Accelerated themes.
5. Close with integration direction (job orchestration + inference observability) and clear non-affiliation language.

Closing sentence template:

"This work contributes the operational UX/control-plane layer needed to make AI-enabled astronomy workflows usable, auditable, and collaborative at scale, while remaining independent and integration-ready."

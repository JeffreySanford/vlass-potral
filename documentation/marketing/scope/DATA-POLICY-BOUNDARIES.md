# Data Policy Boundaries (NRAO/VLASS)

Status date: 2026-02-10  
Purpose: Keep marketing/proposal messaging compliant and permission-first.

## Practical Takeaway

There is no clear public statement that "FITS is categorically forbidden."  
The main constraints are data-rights/proprietary-access controls and archive/policy boundaries.

## Conditions To Respect

1. Proprietary access gate

- NRAO policy states observational data are exclusive to the proposing team during proprietary periods.
- For 2026A and later, regular proprietary period references indicate 24 months for key proposal classes.

1. Restricted proprietary archive access

- Access to proprietary VLA/VLBA archive data is restricted.
- Non-team access may require PI permission via NRAO Helpdesk process.

1. VLASS FITS/cutout workflow is transitional

- Public VLASS product pages describe cutout/curation workflows as evolving.
- Do not assume unrestricted automated FITS pipeline access without explicit confirmation.

1. HiPS viewer != FITS delivery

- Interactive public HiPS workflows are not equivalent to FITS access rights.

1. Policy anchor

- NRAO data-policy pages point to Users’ Policy sections as governing source.

## Operating Rule For vlass-portal Messaging

- Public quick-look workflows: allowed baseline for current project messaging.
- FITS-oriented or derivative-heavy workflows: treat as "permission required until confirmed otherwise."
- Never imply formal authorization from clearance or background status.
  - A clearance does not replace data-rights authorization.

## Outreach Language (Recommended)

Use this sentence in outreach:

"I want to proceed in a policy-compliant way and would appreciate guidance on acceptable FITS access, derivative handling, and integration boundaries before implementing that path."

## Where To Ask First (Recommended)

For permission-sensitive questions, start with NRAO Helpdesk channels:

1. Submit policy/data-rights question via Science Helpdesk.
2. Request explicit guidance on FITS access + derivative handling + whether written approval is required.
3. Ask to be routed to the correct technical lead after policy clarification.

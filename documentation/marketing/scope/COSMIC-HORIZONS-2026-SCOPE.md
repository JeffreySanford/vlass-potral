# Cosmic Horizons 2026 Scope

Status date: 2026-02-10

## Objective

Position `vlass-portal` as the web-native operational interface for AI-driven VLASS and ngVLA-aligned workflows.

## Conference Framing

- Event: Cosmic Horizons Conference 2026 (2nd Annual)
- Dates: July 13-16, 2026
- Location: The Virginia Guest House, Charlottesville, Virginia
- Submission channel: official Whova/CosmicAI/NRAO conference pages

## What Is Already Shipped (Proof)

1. SSR fast first paint
2. Aladin viewer with permalinks and snapshots
3. Community notebook posts with revision history

## Problem Statement

Current astronomy AI ecosystems are strong in models and compute but weaker in production-grade scientific operations UX, orchestration, and reproducibility at the workflow layer.

## Proposed Contribution

`vlass-portal` contributes the missing operations layer:
- role-aware workflow and policy surfaces
- trackable AI job execution interfaces
- reproducibility-linked outputs and collaboration workflows
- human-centered interpretation and review pathways

## Policy and Permission Boundaries

- Current messaging is anchored to public-data-compatible workflows.
- FITS-oriented expansion is treated as permission-gated until explicit guidance is received.
- Proprietary/archive constraints must be respected before implementing any advanced FITS pipeline path.
- NRAO Helpdesk is the first channel for permission-sensitive FITS/policy questions.
- See `documentation/marketing/scope/DATA-POLICY-BOUNDARIES.md`.

## Next Pillars (2-3 Year Alignment)

1. AI inference service integration (short-term, highest leverage)
2. Async job orchestration + federation with institutional compute
3. Explainability/trust dashboards and audit trails

## Audience Fit

- CosmicAI leadership/program operations
- Observable/operational AI working groups
- Research software and cyberinfrastructure teams at partner institutions

## Submission Strategy

1. Submit poster/short talk with infrastructure framing.
2. Use outreach letter to validate program fit early.
3. Bring a concrete live demo pathway (current pillars + next integration milestone).

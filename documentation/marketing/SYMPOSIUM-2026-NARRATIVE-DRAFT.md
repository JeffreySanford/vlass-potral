# Symposium 2026 Narrative: The Human-in-the-Loop Exascale Control Plane

**Present at:** Cosmic Horizons Conference 2s026 (Charlottesville, VA)  
**Status:** Draft Artifact  
**Date:** 2026-02-11

## Abstract

As radio astronomy transitions into the ngVLA era, the primary challenge shifts from raw data collection to the "human bottleneck": the inability of traditional workflows to process, audit, and trust the exascale data volumes (7.5-8 GB/s) generated by modern interferometers.

This presentation introduces **Cosmic Horizon**, an independent, web-native operations interface designed to bridge the gap between institutional exascale compute backplanes and the scientists who must steer them. By providing a "Remote Compute Gateway," the portal allows for the orchestration of autonomous agents—specifically **AlphaCal** for direction-dependent calibration and **CosmicAI** reconstruction models—while preserving critical human-in-the-loop auditability.

## Key Pillars of the Control Plane

1. **Remote Compute Gateway (Planned Integration):** Replacing legacy local data downloads with a web-native interface to TACC-scale resources.
2. **Auditability and Trust:** Human-verified snapshots of agent-generated products to ensure scientific reproducibility.
3. **Explainable Universe:** Using community-sourced notebooks and persistent viewer states to document AI-driven discoveries.

## Technical Performance Targets

- **First Paint:** < 1s (SSR-Optimized)
- **Job Orchestration Latency:** < 500ms (API Overhead)
- **Data Fidelity:** 100% preservation of FITS metadata via PASSTHROUGH policy.

# Release Notes - 2026-02-07

Status date: 2026-02-07

## Summary

This snapshot aligns docs and implementation after completing Pillar 1 and
hardening auth + E2E reliability.

## Delivered

- Pillar 1 complete: SSR first paint on auth/landing with client telemetry overlay
- Credential auth registration and login (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`)
- JWT session handling in frontend auth flows
- Auth API/controller/service/repository tests expanded
- Web register flow integrated to API with error-state handling
- Playwright auth e2e stabilized (mock routing and selector reliability)
- Infra startup flow standardized via `start:all` / `start:infra`

## Quality Gate Snapshot

Validated on 2026-02-07:

```bash
pnpm nx run-many -t lint --all
pnpm nx run-many -t test --all
pnpm nx run mvp-gates:e2e
```

## Notes

- `run-many -t e2e --all` is broader than MVP gates and may surface
  multi-browser/continuous-task contention not representative of the required
  release gate.
- Canonical scope remains:
  - `documentation/product/PRODUCT-CHARTER.md`
  - `SCOPE-LOCK.md`

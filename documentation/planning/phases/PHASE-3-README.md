# Phase 3: CosmicAI Federation & ngVLA Preparation

Welcome to Phase 3 planning documentation. This phase establishes vlass-portal as the scientific operations platform for CosmicAI's distributed infrastructure and prepares for ngVLA's 50-petaflop data challenge.

## Quick Overview

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Timeline** | 16–20 weeks |
| **Effort** | 2–3 FTE engineers (distributed systems focus) |
| **Cost** | $200K–$400K (engineering + compute allocation) |
| **Key Deliverable** | Federated multi-site inference + TACC integration |
| **Success Definition** | 15+ institutions using vlass-portal; 5+ peer-reviewed papers; 20%+ using TACC compute |

## Phase 3 Success Metrics

**Technical:**

- TACC job submission success rate ≥95%
- Data federation latency <3s for multi-site queries
- Reproducibility manifest completeness 100%

**User-facing:**

- 15+ NSF-affiliated institutions running analyses via vlass-portal
- 5+ published peer-reviewed papers citing vlass-portal reproducibility
- Community notebook posts using TACC compute ≥20%

**Strategic:**

- Demonstration site for NSF SI² or DOE ASCR funding
- Cited in ngVLA operations planning documents
- CosmicAI formally acknowledges vlass-portal as primary interface
- NRAO management identifies vlass-portal as strategic asset

## Key Dates & Milestones

# Phase 3: CosmicAI Federation & ngVLA Preparation

Welcome to Phase 3 planning documentation. This phase establishes cosmic-horizons as the scientific operations platform for CosmicAI's distributed infrastructure and prepares for ngVLA's 50-petaflop data challenge.

## Quick Overview

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |

| **Timeline** | 16–20 weeks |

| **Effort** | 2–3 FTE engineers (distributed systems focus) |

| **Cost** | $200K–$400K (engineering + compute allocation) |

| **Key Deliverable** | Federated multi-site inference + TACC integration |

| **Success Definition** | 15+ institutions using cosmic-horizons; 5+ peer-reviewed papers; 20%+ using TACC compute |

## Phase 3 Success Metrics

**Technical:**

- TACC job submission success rate ≥95%

- Data federation latency <3s for multi-site queries

- Reproducibility manifest completeness 100%

**User-facing:**

- 15+ NSF-affiliated institutions running analyses via cosmic-horizons

- 5+ published peer-reviewed papers citing cosmic-horizons reproducibility

- Community notebook posts using TACC compute ≥20%

**Strategic:**

- Demonstration site for NSF SI² or DOE ASCR funding

- Cited in ngVLA operations planning documents

- CosmicAI formally acknowledges cosmic-horizons as primary interface

- NRAO management identifies cosmic-horizons as strategic asset

## Key Dates & Milestones

- **Oct 2026**: Phase 3 begins (grant-funded or extended timeline)

- **Oct–Dec 2026**: TACC integration + authentication

- **Jan–Mar 2027**: Data federation and remote job orchestration

- **Apr–Jun 2027**: Multi-site reproducibility + community pilot

- **Jul 2027**: Full operational readiness; Cosmic Horizons feedback cycle

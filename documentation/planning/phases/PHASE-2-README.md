# Phase 2: AI Integration Foundation

Welcome to Phase 2 planning documentation. This phase transforms vlass-portal into an AI-driven scientific operations platform by integrating CosmicAI algorithms for inference, reproducibility, and explainability.

- **[PHASE-2-AI-INTEGRATION.md](PHASE-2-AI-INTEGRATION.md)** — Complete Phase 2 technical planning document
  - Four core pillars (Inference, Job Orchestration, Reproducibility, Explainability)
  - Technical architecture and backend services
  - Success criteria and timeline

- **[FUNDING-AND-COSTS.md](../funding/FUNDING-AND-COSTS.md)** — Funding strategy and cost breakdown (shared with Phase 3)

## Quick Overview

| Aspect | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Timeline** | 12–16 weeks |
| **Effort** | 1.5–2 FTE engineers |
| **Cost** | $100K–$200K (engineering labor only) |
| **Key Deliverable** | Local AI inference service + reproducibility framework |
| **Success Definition** | 10+ published posts with AI results; 3+ users running reproducible analyses |

## Phase 2 Success Metrics

**Technical:**

- Inference service latency <10s for typical calibration check
- 99%+ job completion rate
- Full reproducibility linkage on 100% of results

**User-facing:**

- 10+ published posts containing inference results
- 3+ users running reproducibility forks
- 80%+ confidence in explanation UI

**Strategic:**

- Can credibly claim "AI-driven" in funding applications
- Demonstrates readiness for TACC partnership (Phase 3)

## Key Dates & Milestones

- **Feb–Apr 2026**: Start Phase 2 (unfunded or internally supported)
- **May–Aug 2026**: Parallel with grant writing (NSF/DOE proposals due Apr–Jun)
- **Sep –Oct 2026**: Phase 2 completion; Phase 3 readiness assessment
- **Oct 2026+**: Begin Phase 3 with grant funding (if awarded) or extended timeline

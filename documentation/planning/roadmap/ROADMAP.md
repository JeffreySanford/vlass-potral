# Roadmap

Status date: 2026-02-08

Canonical scope: `documentation/product/PRODUCT-CHARTER.md` and `SCOPE-LOCK.md`.

**Technical reference:** See [../../architecture/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md](../../architecture/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed MVP stack, development operations, and v1.1/2.0 planning.

Tracking rule:

- `ROADMAP.md` is forward-looking (what is next).
- Completed implementation history is journaled in `TODO.md` ("Archived Completed Items") and release notes.

## MVP (v1.0)

1. Pillar 1: SSR first paint

- Landing SSR preview
- Performance tuning for FCP/LCP targets
- Status: complete (SSR regional preview on auth/landing, client-only telemetry overlay, gated perf tests)

1. Pillar 2: Viewer + permalink + snapshots

- Aladin integration (Mode A only)
- Viewer state encoding/decoding
- Persistent permalink resolution
- PNG snapshot workflow
- Labeling centered targets in viewer state
- FITS science cutout download path
- Status: complete (Mode A + state/permalink/snapshot/cutout + reliability hardening + telemetry dashboarding)

1. Pillar 3: Community notebooks

- Post create/edit/read
- Revision history and diff
- Moderation controls for posts
- Tag workflow
- Status: complete (post create/edit/publish + revisions + hide/lock moderation flow are implemented and tested)

1. Foundations

- Auth + verification gates
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting
- CI baseline test gate

## v1.0 Completion

- MVP pillars are implemented in local environment.
- Remaining work before public deployment is operational hardening (performance tuning, CI trend baselines, release packaging).
- **Label hover feature**: Completed with 1-second debounce for bandwidth efficiency
- **Planet resolution**: Multi-layered fallback resolver (Aladin → SkyBot → VizieR → Hardcoded) implemented and documented

## v1.1 (Quick wins) — Active Development

### Interim: Astropy Ephemeris Backend (Starting Now)

See [../phases/PHASE-2-EPHEMERIS-BACKEND.md](../phases/PHASE-2-EPHEMERIS-BACKEND.md) for detailed planning.

- Scientific ephemeris calculation (Astropy library)
- Real-time planet/asteroid positions (±1 arcsecond accuracy)
- Replaces hardcoded fallback coordinates with accurate time-dependent values
- Redis caching for performance (24h TTL)
- JPL Horizons API fallback for extended object catalog
- **Timeline**: 3-6 weeks
- **Impact**: Enables AI-driven coordinate calibration features (Phase 2)

### Other v1.1 Features (Planned After Ephemeris)

- Comments/replies system
- User profile polish
- Feed ranking and discovery improvements
- Target resolution enhancements for minor planets and comets

## Phase 2: AI Integration Foundation

See [../phases/PHASE-2-README.md](../phases/PHASE-2-README.md) for overview and [../phases/PHASE-2-AI-INTEGRATION.md](../phases/PHASE-2-AI-INTEGRATION.md) for detailed planning.

- Pillar 1: Inference service layer (calibration anomaly detection, AlphaCal, event detection)
- Pillar 2: GPU job orchestration (local + Kubernetes-ready)
- Pillar 3: Reproducibility framework (experiment graphs, versioning, replay)
- Pillar 4: Explainability UI (saliency, attribution, confidence scoring)

**Strategic alignment:** NSF-Simons CosmicAI Institute  
**Timeline:** ~12–16 weeks  
**Cost:** $100K–$200K (engineering labor)  
**Milestone:** vlass-portal becomes AI-driven scientific platform

## Phase 3: CosmicAI Federation & ngVLA Preparation

See [../phases/PHASE-3-README.md](../phases/PHASE-3-README.md) for overview and [../phases/PHASE-3-COSMICAI-FEDERATION.md](../phases/PHASE-3-COSMICAI-FEDERATION.md) for detailed planning.

- Pillar 1: Dataset federation (NRAO + CosmicAI curations + TACC)
- Pillar 2: TACC compute integration (Slurm + remote job orchestration)
- Pillar 3: Multi-site reproducibility (federated lineage tracking)
- Pillar 4: Explainability aggregation (multi-model consensus, uncertainty quantification)

**Strategic alignment:** TACC partnership, ngVLA operations preparation  
**Timeline:** ~16–20 weeks  
**Cost:** $200K–$400K (engineering + compute, often grant-funded)  
**Milestone:** vlass-portal becomes scientific operations platform for radio astronomy AI workflows

## Funding & Cost Strategy

See [FUNDING-AND-COSTS.md](../funding/FUNDING-AND-COSTS.md) for comprehensive cost breakdown, grant strategy, and timeline to funding (NSF SI², DOE ASCR, NVIDIA GPU Research, NSF CIS).

## v2 (Deferred to Post-Phase 3)

- Mode B canvas viewer
- FITS proxy/caching and advanced download controls
- Optional Rust render tier for heavy compute paths
- Comments/replies on posts

## Out of Scope for MVP (Phases 1–3)

- Go microservice (removed from MVP; may revisit for specialized data processing)
- Full FITS archive/mirror tier (cutout passthrough suffices; proxy deferred)
- Custom model training or fine-tuning
- ngVLA data ingestion (await official ngVLA data release; infrastructure ready by Phase 3)

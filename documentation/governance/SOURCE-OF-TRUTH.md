# Source of Truth Model

Status date: 2026-02-07

## Canonical Product Scope

1. `documentation/product/PRODUCT-CHARTER.md`

2. `SCOPE-LOCK.md`

## Canonical Interface/Contract Models

3. `libs/shared/models`

When conflicts exist:

- Product/scope conflicts resolve to charter + scope lock.

- API/data contract conflicts resolve to shared models and active code/migrations.

## Documentation Classification

- Active MVP docs: implementation guidance for current scope.

- Deferred docs: future v1.1/v2 scope, not actionable for MVP.

- Archived docs: historical context only.

- External context docs: strategy/trend inputs that are not themselves implementation truth.

## CosmicAI and ngVLA Context Classification

- `AGENTS.md` (`CosmicAI Docking & AI Control Plane`) is strategic operating context for agent behavior and integration intent.

- `documentation/planning/phases/PHASE-3-COSMICAI-FEDERATION.md` and conference/marketing scope docs are planning references.

- These documents guide roadmap direction but do not override implementation scope truth in the charter/scope lock.

## External Claims Governance

- External trend/institution statements follow `documentation/governance/EXTERNAL-RESEARCH-WORKFLOW.md`.

- External claims may inform planning, but do not override product scope or implemented facts.

## Success Threshold

Project documentation/quality governance target is >= 95 on the status scorecard
## defined in `documentation/governance/STATUS.md`

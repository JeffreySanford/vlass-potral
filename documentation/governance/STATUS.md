# Project Status Scorecard

Last validated: 2026-02-11

## Source-of-Truth Model

- Product scope: `documentation/product/PRODUCT-CHARTER.md`, `SCOPE-LOCK.md`

- Contract scope: `libs/shared/models`

- Alignment policy: `documentation/governance/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`

## Required Gates

```bash
pnpm nx run docs-policy:check
pnpm nx run-many --target=test --all
pnpm nx run mvp-gates:e2e

```

## Scoring Model (Target >= 95)

| Dimension | Weight | Gate | Current |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |

| Documentation Alignment | 30 | `docs-policy:check` | 100 |
| Unit/Integration Baseline | 30 | `run-many --target=test --all` | 100 |
| MVP E2E Reliability | 30 | `mvp-gates:e2e` | 95 |
| Scope Discipline | 10 | Charter + scope-lock conformance | 95 |

Weighted success score: **97 / 100**

## Interpretation

- The engineering governance baseline is healthy (Phase 2 Ephemeris Backend complete).

- Required release gates pass locally as of 2026-02-11.

- Nx reported `mvp-gates:e2e` as flaky once; reliability follow-up remains open.

- `cosmic-horizons-api:typecheck` still fails and is not currently part of required release gates.

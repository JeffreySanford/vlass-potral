# External Claims References Appendix

**Status date:** 2026-02-11  
**Applies to:** overview deck/audio/video assets in `documentation/overview/`

---

## Purpose

Track source-dated references for external numeric claims used in overview assets.

Classification tags:

- `verified_external`: source located and dated.
- `planning_hypothesis`: directional planning claim; no stable external source confirmed yet.

## Claim Table

| Claim in assets | Status | Source(s) | Notes for publishing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ngVLA has `244` main antennas + `19` short-baseline antennas | `verified_external` | `https://ngvla.nrao.edu/page/faq` (accessed 2026-02-11) | Keep exact wording aligned to FAQ naming. |
| Frequency coverage `1.2-116 GHz` | `verified_external` | `https://ngvla.nrao.edu/page/faq` (accessed 2026-02-11) | Keep as capability/plan context, not operational today claim. |
| Imaging compute requirement around `60 PFLOPS` (or `50-60 PFLOPS`) | `verified_external` | `https://ngvla.nrao.edu/page/faq` (accessed 2026-02-11) | Use "compute model estimates" wording. |
| Cosmic Horizons 2026 dates `July 13-16, 2026` | `verified_external` | `https://www.cosmicai.org/events/cosmic-horizons-conference-2026` (accessed 2026-02-11) | Keep conference logistics date-stamped. |
| Abstract deadline `April 1, 2026` | `verified_external` | `documentation/marketing/abstracts/COSMIC-HORIZONS-2026-SUBMISSION-PLAYBOOK.md` + conference channels re-check requirement | Re-verify on official submission page at time of upload. |
| ngVLA annual archive/data growth `240 PB/year` | `planning_hypothesis` | Strategic context in `AGENTS.md`; no authoritative source confirmed in this audit | Keep as planning estimate; avoid hard-fact phrasing unless externally sourced. |
| Data rate `128 GB/sec` | `planning_hypothesis` | Appears in deck visuals; no authoritative source confirmed in this audit | Label as scenario estimate or remove from external-facing deck. |
| Single 4-hour observation `~109 TB` | `planning_hypothesis` | Appears in deck/media narration; no authoritative source confirmed in this audit | Keep only with "planning estimate" qualifier. |
| `10,000x` compute increase vs legacy systems | `planning_hypothesis` | Appears in deck/media narration; no authoritative source confirmed in this audit | Prefer "orders-of-magnitude increase" unless cited. |

## Required Usage Rule

If a claim row is `planning_hypothesis`, assets must use softened language:

- `estimated`, `planning context`, `scenario`, or `order-of-magnitude`.

Do not present `planning_hypothesis` rows as settled institutional fact.

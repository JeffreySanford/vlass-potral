# Exascale Deck Wording Patch

**Status date:** 2026-02-11  
**Applies to:** `documentation/overview/The_Exascale_Control_Plane.pdf` and derivative visuals

---

## Purpose

Provide exact wording replacements to align deck language with current scope lock and claim governance.

---

## Required Replacement

Replace:

- `Go Microservice`

With:

- `Remote Compute Gateway (Planned)`

Reason:

- `SCOPE-LOCK.md` removed Go microservice scope for MVP and current architecture truth.

---

## Additional Wording Normalization (Recommended)

Wherever the deck implies current institutional deployment, replace with integration-ready language:

- `deployed for CosmicAI` -> `integration-ready for CosmicAI-style workflows`
- `official interface` -> `independent operations interface`
- `production AlphaCal service` -> `AlphaCal integration target (planned)`

---

## Numeric Claim Footer (Required)

Add this footer to any slide containing ecosystem-scale metrics:

`Planning context unless otherwise cited; see references appendix for source dates and verification status.`

---

## Non-Affiliation Footer (Required)

Add this line to title and closing slides (or presenter notes if slide space is constrained):

`Cosmic Horizon is an independent, public-data-compatible, integration-ready web platform; it is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or operated by VLA/NRAO/VLASS.`

---

## Render Note

This repository currently stores exported media artifacts (PDF/audio/video).  
Apply the replacements in the editable slide source before the next export.

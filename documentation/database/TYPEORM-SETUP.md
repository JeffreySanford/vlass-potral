# TypeORM Setup (MVP)

Status date: 2026-02-07

Use TypeORM entities aligned with active MVP schema:

- User
- Post
- Revision
- Snapshot
- AuditLog
- Optional cache entities

Deferred entities:

- Comment-related entities (v1.1)

If model docs conflict with code, trust current entities and migrations.

For SQL bootstrap and local seed account behavior, see `documentation/database/SEEDING-OPERATIONS.md`.

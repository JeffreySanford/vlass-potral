# Database Schema (MVP)

Status date: 2026-02-07

This document is aligned to MVP entities and shared model contracts.

## Core MVP Tables
- users
- posts
- revisions
- snapshots
- audit_logs
- vlass_tile_cache (if enabled)

## Deferred Tables
- comments and comment-like entities are v1.1 scope.

When schema docs conflict with runtime DTOs, defer to `libs/shared/models` and active migrations.

Seeding and bootstrap behavior is documented in `documentation/database/SEEDING-OPERATIONS.md`.
